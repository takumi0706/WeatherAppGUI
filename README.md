#This is WeatherApp_Vesion_PerfectGUI(than my old WeatherApp)
The backend of this program obtains longitude, latitude, and longitude/latitude from place names from the geolocation API, populates them with Open-Meteo, and outputs the weather forecast API.
The front end of this program uses javaswing. I used JavaFX for the previous WeatherApp, but this time I used it to study swing.
